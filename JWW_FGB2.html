				Lesson 2: Breathings, Syllables, Elision, Accent, Punctuation.
			</h1>
			
			<h2 class='title2'>
				Breathings
			</h2>
			<p>
				<strong><a name='14'></a>14.</strong> Every vowel or diphthong at the beginning of a word has either the rough breathing (῾) or the smooth breathing ( ᾽) mark. The rough breathing shows that the vowel is <em>aspirated</em>, i.e. that it is preceded by the sound of <em>h</em>, as ἡ-μέ-ρα, <em>day</em>, υἱ-ος, <em>son</em>, Ἑλ-λη-νι-κός, <em>Greek</em>; the smooth breathing shows that the vowel is not aspirated, as ἄ-γω, <em>I lead</em>, Ἄρ-τε-μις, <em>Artimis</em>, ᾤ-κη-σα, <em>I dwelt</em>.
			</p>
			<h2 class='title2'>
				Syllables
			</h2>
			<p>
				<strong><a name='15'></a>15.</strong> A Greek word has as many syllables as it has separate vowels or diphthongs. A Syllable is <em>long</em> by nature when it has a long vowel or diphthong.
			</p>
			<p>
				In dividing a word into syllables, single consonants and combinations of consonants which can begin a word are, with few exceptions, placed at the beginning of the syllable; other combinations of consonants are divided. Thus φο-βε-ρός, <em>frightful</em> ὁ-πλῑ-της, <em>hoplite</em>, but ἁρ-πά-ζω, <em>I plunder</em>.
			</p>
			<h2 class='title2'>
				Elision
			</h2>
			<p>
				<strong><a name='16'></a>16.</strong> A short final vowel may be dropped when the next word begins with a vowel, whether this has the rough or the smooth breathing. This is called elision. An apostrophe marks the omission. Thus ἐπ'αὐτόν, <em>against him</em>, for ἐπι αὐτόν.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong><a name='17'></a>17.</strong> Most words ending in σι, and all the verbs of the third person ending in ε, generally add ν, when the next word begins with a vowel, as ἔχυοσιν οἰκίᾱς, <em>they have houses</em> εἶχεν οἰκίᾱν, <em>he had a house</em>. This is called ν movable. It may also be added at the end of a sentence.
			</p>
			<h2 class='title2'>
				Accent
			</h2>
			<p>
				<strong><a name='18'></a>18.</strong> There are three accents:
			</p>
			<p>
				the acute (´), as ἀ-γα-θός, <em>good</em> ἡ-μέ-ρα, <em>day</em> Ἄρ-τε-μις, <em>Artemis</em>, ᾤ-κη-σα, <em>I dwelt;</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				the grave (`), as σκη–ναὶ ἀ-γα-θαι, <em>good tents</em>;
			</p>
			<p>
				the circumflex ( ῀ ), as σκη-νῆς, <em>of a tent</em> ὦ–δε, <em>thus</em> ἐν σκη-ναῖς, <em>in tents</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong><a name='19'></a>19.</strong> The acute can stand only on one of the last three syllables of a word, the circumflex only on one of the last two, and the grave only on the last.
			</p>
			<p class="new">
				The last syllable in a word is called the ultima, the second to last syllable is called the penult, and the syllable before the penult is called the antepenult.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong><a name='20'></a>20.</strong> The circumflex can stand only on a long syllable. When long ᾱ, ῑ, ῡ have the circumflex, the long mark is omitted, and the are written ᾶ, ῖ, ῦ.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong><a name='21'></a>21.</strong> The antepenult, if accented, takes the acute, as ἄν-θρω-πος, <em>man</em>; but it can have no accent if the last syllable is long or ends in ξ or ψ, as ἀ-νθρώ-που, <em>of a man</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong><a name='22'></a>22.</strong> An accented penult is circumflexed when it is long while the last syllable is short, as δῶ-ρον, <em>gift</em>, Otherwise, it takes the acute, as δώ–ρου, <em>of a gift</em>, χώ-ρᾱ, <em>land, country</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong><a name='23'></a>23.</strong> Final αι and οι are counted as short in determining the accent, as ἀ-μα-ξαι, <em>wagons</em> χῶ-ραι, <em>lands</em>, except in the optative, and the adverb οἴ-κοι, <em>at home</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong><a name='24'></a>24.</strong> An accented ultima has the acute when short, as ἀ-γα-θός, <em>good</em>; the acute or circumflex when long, as σκη-νή, <em>tent</em>, σκη-νῆς, <em>of a tent</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong><a name='25'></a>25.</strong> A word which, like σκη–νή, <em>tent</em>, has the acute on the last syllable is called the oxytone (i.e. sharp-tones). An oxytone changes its acute to the grave before other words in the same sentence, as σκη–νὴ ἀ-γα-θῃ, <em>a good tent</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong><a name='26'></a>26.</strong> Some monosyllables have no accent and are closely attached to the following word, as ἐν σκη-νῇ, <em>in a tent</em>. These are called proclitics.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong><a name='27'></a>27.</strong> An enclitic is a word which loses its own accent and is pronounced as if it were part of the preceding word, as ᾿ἄν-θρω-ποι τε.
			</p>
			<h2 class='title2'>
				Punctuation
			</h2>
			<p>
				<strong><a name='28'></a>28.</strong> The Greek uses the comma and period as in English. It also has a colon, ( · ) a point above the line, which is equivalent to the English colon and semicolon. The mark of interrogation is ( ; ), it is the same as the English semicolon. So in Greek, “ ;” is equal to the English “?”.
